                    Hello! I'm a junior web developer with a passion for creating functional and elegant web solutions. 
                    My journey in web development began with learning the fundamentals of PHP and gradually expanding 
                    to modern frameworks and tools.

                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I specialize in backend development with PHP and Laravel, working with MySQL databases to build 
                    robust and scalable applications. On the frontend, I enjoy working with Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap 
                    to create responsive and user-friendly interfaces.
                </p>
                <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                    I'm always eager to learn new technologies and best practices. I believe in writing clean, 
                    maintainable code and following industry standards. My goal is to continue growing as a developer 
                    and contribute to meaningful projects.
                </p>

                    When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, 
                    and continuously improving my skills through practice and learning.
